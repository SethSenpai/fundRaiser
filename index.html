<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Mira is a discord bot that brings joy and hope to many a discord server with her cute smile and her ability to pull images from the web.
Danbooru (the website that mira pulls her images from) has a limit on its api calls and tags, this limimt can be removed by getting a paid account. Getting her a paid account requires $20.</p>
<p><b>This is a one time payment not a subscription, so no more fundraisers after this one</b><p>
<p>When Mira gets a paid account there will be no more restrictions on what tags you can search for. It also allows you to imput 5 tags at a time to search even more specificly</p>
<h3>Why a fundraiser</h3>
<p>As MkLovin once said: "I am a sad, lonely college student." This is the reason for the fundraiser. If I end up collecting more then the $20 required there are 2 things that can happen. We also breach $40 which allows me to buy a platinum level acount for mira which includes the use of 11 tags. Any money below or above that number will be used by me to buy food. I will take the page down ASAP when the balance reaches more then $20.</p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>I am Seth, better known as Seth-Senpai in most discord chats. I am a university major currently inbetween studies. I also like cute anime girl. (which you may have noticed)</p>
